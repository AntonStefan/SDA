Quadtree - A ppm image compression program

Compilation:
    The program can be compiled using the included makefile by using the make
command.

Usage:
    - compression:
        ./quadtree -c [threshold] [input_file] [output_file]
        where [threshold] can be any unsigned integer
    - decompression
        ./quadtree -d [input_file] [output_file]

Notes:
    The program only works on square ppm images with size equal to a power of 2.

How it works:
    As the name suggests, the program uses quadtrees, a tree data structure in
which each node has exactly four children.
    For compression, the image is recursively split into quarters until a
similarity score based on the average color of each quarter is less or equal
than the given threshold. The data for each quarter is stored as a quadtree node.
    For decompression, the image is recursively reconstructed from the data
in a given quadtree.
